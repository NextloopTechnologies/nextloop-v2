              We all know that technology is rapidly changing the healthcare
              industry. From electronic health records (EHRs) to telemedicine,

              Custom Software solutions involve a process in which software is
              specifically designed for a particular healthcare organization.
              They can be used to improve a variety of tasks and processes, such
              as:
            </p>
            <ul className='list-disc text-sm md:text-lg pl-5 md:pl-10 mt-2 mb-2'>
